# Determining risk of developing Parkinson's disease from small RNA transcriptomics

Authors: Evan Collins and Brian Cheng

This repository is for the 20.440 final project at MIT. The objective of this project is to evaluate the small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) expression profiles from whole blood that are significantly different between healthy, prodromal (at risk), and Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects. These findings will in turn enable us to build models to predict PD risk using machine learning.

Data for this project is sourced from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Brian and I obtained access to PPMI by signing user agreements. As part of the user agreement, we cannot make public any raw data from PPMI. Professor Blainey has allowed this. 

For PSET 4, rather than focusing on small RNA-seq data, I analyzed clinical data available in PPMI, with the objective of trying to reveal how prodromal subjects' demographics and more qualitative symptom presentations (i.e., clinical variables) differ compared to those of PD subjects. This analysis will aid us in formulating hypotheses once we begin evaluating small RNA-seq data to distinguish the cohorts.

This PSET 4-specific repository contains only one script (`plot_pca_prodromal_vs_pd.R`) to generate one figure (`pca_biplot_prodromal_vs_pd.png`). The script generates a PCA biplot figure to show principal component scores [points] of PD subjects vs. prodromal subjects and show loadings of the significant clinical variables [vectors] that distinguish the two cohorts. The script contains extensive comments explaining the standard data processing and statistical techniques used.

## Repository structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `/data`: an open folder where user adds necessary data as specified in the section **Downloading PPMI data** below.

- `/scripts`: contains the .R scripts used to process data and generate figures.

- `/figures`: contains the figures used in the report.

*Note that additional folders and files will be added as the project progresses. This `README.md` will be updated accordingly.*

## Downloading PPMI data

All data analyzed in this project is sourced from PPMI. As specified in the user agreement, we cannot make public any data from PPMI. To apply for access to PPMI data, visit [this page](https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/download-data). 

Once access is granted, download the two `.csv` files required to run the script for PSET 4.

1. `PPMI_Prodromal_Cohort_BL_to_Year_1_Dataset_Apr2020.csv`

2. `PPMI_Original_Cohort_BL_to_Year_5_Dataset_Apr2020.csv`

Once downloaded, put these files in the `/data` folder.

## Running the code

To run the script (`scripts/plot_pca_prodromal_vs_pd.R`) and generate the figure (`figures/pca_biplot_prodromal_vs_pd.png`) for PSET 4, simply `cd [path]/scripts` and run the command. 

```bash
Rscript plot_pca_prodromal_vs_pd.R
```

Note that this R script was run with R version 4.1.1 and uses two non-base packages, `ggplot2` (version 3.4.1) and `factoextra` (version 1.0.7). The R script commences by ensuring installation of both packages with these specific versions.
